### 11/24/2024 - First things first

The point of this website is to build a personal website that highlight's personal projects using concepts we've learned in Caterina Paun's Intro to WebDev at PSU. I am going to attempt to create something that is more oriented toward my personal game development endeavours by theme-ing the website with elements from LunaLight. I will highlight some of the milestones in that project as well as other projects I have done.

**Some technical constraints**

To check the boxes around concepts learned in WebDev this site should be built using the following:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Intitial deployment of the site will use GitHub pages.
