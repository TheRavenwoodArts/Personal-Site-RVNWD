Dry Etch - Engineering

As a senior engineering technician I oversaw, executed and developed troubleshooting plans to solve nonstandard problems on complex machinery used in the production of semiconductor processors. This includes working with a team of technicians to perform specific projects, learning new software/machinery, training, troubleshooting and developing work plans as well as maintaining parts, equipment and tools needed to perform those tasks.
