I had an amazing experience getting to be the Team Lead for my computer science capstone project. During which I lead a team of seven student software engineers to implement the UI/UX, middle-end and API service for the Community Resource Network Mobile Application. The Community Resource Network is a local non-profit organization that works to connect in-need people with resources.
The CRN needs a cross-platform mobile application to support their growing network and ever-expanding community of organizers, donors and requesters. Through this the Community Resource Network will be enabled to meet the needs of the increasing number of folks who can benefit from their organization.
To accomplish this we used the C# framework .NET MAUI, Multi-platform Application User Interface. Check out our demo narrated by one of our talented student developers, Marvin.
