## 11/24/2024 - First things first

The point of this website is to build a personal website that highlight's personal projects using concepts we've learned in Caterina Paun's Intro to WebDev at PSU. I am going to attempt to create something that is more oriented toward my personal game development endeavours by theme-ing the website with elements from LunaLight. I will highlight some of the milestones in that project as well as other projects I have done.

**Some technical constraints**

To check the boxes around concepts learned in WebDev this site should be built using the following:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GitHub pages for deployment 

### High Level Implementation Plan

**Concept**: *This will be a single-page scrolling website with a fixed navigation bar that alows the user to jump to sections.*

1) Sketch a layout design for the following required sections:
    
    - Navbar: Fixed at the top.
    - About: Brief introduction and a professional photo.
    - Previous Work: Resume highlights or course/skills section.
    - Projects: Showcase 2-3 projects with links to GitHub/deployed sites.
    - Contact: Form for user inquiries.
2) Build basic HTML structure to represent each section.
3) Style the website with CSS.
4) Implement website interactivity with Javascript.
    
    - Scrolling
    - Form validation
    - Email contact
    - Embedded YouTube Video
5) Test, Refine and Repeat (steps 3-5)
6) Deployment with GitHub pages *(we'll worry about this when we get there)*

### A starting point

Just to get things going I'm going to bring some initial files that create a form with user input functionality. 

`form.html`, `form.js` and `styles.css`

These files create a simple form that gets user input and prints it to the console. We will build the entire website from here ;)

## 11/25/2024 - Design

Here's a quick design sketch that captures te aesthetic of the site and some styling. I want the site to mainy highlight my current retro-style game ev project so I think using some pixel art fro mthat as the background is a cool idea.

*Note*: I did this in procreate, which is not great for this sort of thing.
