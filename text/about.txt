I’m a creative and resourceful problem-solver with a deep passion for blending technology and art. With a foundation as an Engineering Technician and years of freelance experience in illustration, graphic design and music, I bring a unique perspective that unites technical expertise with creative vision. My love for game development, music, and illustration has driven me to craft meaningful projects, including a retro game development initiative that showcases my dedication to combining art and technology.

As a recent Computer Science graduate from Portland State University, I’ve honed my skills in web and mobile app development, backend architecture, and project leadership. Through hands-on internships and academic projects, I’ve built dynamic web applications, cross-platform mobile apps, and integrated APIs, working with diverse programming languages like Python, Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Leading a collaborative capstone project further solidified my ability to guide teams and deliver impactful software solutions. I thrive at the intersection of creativity and technology, continuously pushing boundaries to create innovative and engaging experiences.
