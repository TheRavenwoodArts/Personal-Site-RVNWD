I am a creative problem-solver who thrives at the intersection of art and technology. With a background in illustration, design, music and engineering I found that software development is the perfect amalgam of my creative passions. 

A few years ago I embarked on a creative project aimed at combining these different creative skills through game development. My current project is a retro-style platformer called LunaLight and has only solidified my interests in software development. Working on the game showed me that this is what I want, so I went to school to become a software developer. Now multiple rewarding projects, internships and a computer science degree later, I am ready to put knowledge to the test through professional development and keep developing my own retro game projects on the side! Check out some of the sprite work and concept art from my current game project!
