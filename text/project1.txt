This game project is what got me into software development!

LunaLight is a sci-fi fantasy rogue-ish platformer built in the retro style of our favoite games from the late 80's and early 90's. 

As someone with a background in art, music and engineering I needed a way to put all of my interests together. Game development is exactly what I was looking for!
In this project I am the writer, designer, pixel artist, music composer and software developer. The game is built using the C# framework MonoGame and will hopefully be available to demo very soon!
